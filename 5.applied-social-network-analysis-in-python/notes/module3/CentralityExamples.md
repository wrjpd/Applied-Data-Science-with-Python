# Comparing Centrality Measures
- No pair of centrality measures produces the exact same ranking of nodes, but they have some commonalities
- Centrality measures make different assumptions about what it means to be a "central" node. Thus, they produce different rankings.
- The ebst centrality measure depends on the context of the network one is analyzing.
- When identifying central nodes, it is usually best to use multiple centrality measures instead of relying on a single one.
