# Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
- Generative model for a document d
    - Choose length of document d
    - Choose a mixture of topics for document d
    - Use a topic's multinomial distribution to output words to fill that topic's quota
 
## Topic Modeling in Practice
- How many topics?
    - Finding or even guessing the number of topics is hard
- Interpreting topics
    - Topics are just word distributions
    - Making sense of words / generating labels is subjective
